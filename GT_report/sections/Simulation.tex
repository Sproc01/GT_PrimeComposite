\section{Simulation} \label{section:Simulation}% Michele
To understand if the first player has some moving advantage, we had to run several simulations by comparing the different strategies explained in section \ref{section: Strategies} in the two cases that we want to compare:
\begin{itemize}
    \item General case: the starting player is decided by the random cards that they got.
    \item Player 1 always starting: we forced the fact that the player 1 has the card corresponding to number two.
\end{itemize}
In order to achieve this, firstly we generate the different possible configurations of cards by assigning each card uniformly at random between the two players. Then for each assignment, we run the game comparing every possible pair of strategies from the two players.
