Our analysis indicates that the game, in its general form, exhibits a balanced design. The observed winning probabilities for the majority of strategies converge towards a 50/50 distribution as you can see in figure \ref{fig:prob_general}, suggesting a fair game. While certain strategies deviate from this balance, leading to unbalanced probabilities, these instances are confined to a narrow subset of strategies that are less realistic.

To investigate potential first-mover or second-mover advantages, we analyzed the game dynamics with a fixed starting player. Our findings suggest that such advantages are negligible. The observed variations in winning probabilities when comparing the general case with the scenario where Player 1 always starts are minimal, with a modest 5 \% increase. Furthermore, there are some significant shifts in winning probability, 25 \% decrease for the starting player, but these decreases are primarily observed within the unrealistic strategies considered before. So we can say that we don't have first-mover or second-mover advantages.
