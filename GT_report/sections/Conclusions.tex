\section{Conclusions} \label{section:Conclusions}
Our analysis indicates that the game, in its general form, exhibits a balanced design. The observed winning probabilities for the majority of strategies converge towards a 50/50 distribution, as you can see in figure \ref{fig:prob_general}, suggesting a fair game. While certain strategies deviate from this balance, leading to unbalanced probabilities, these instances are confined to a narrow subset of strategies, where 1 player plays an advanced strategy while the other plays a dumb strategy like the random one.

To investigate potential first-mover or second-mover advantages, we analyzed the game dynamics with a fixed starting player. Our findings suggest that the game is balanced because the cards are assigned randomly at the beginning, but if we fix the starting player, there is a first-mover advantage for simple strategies. However, the situation flips when some advanced strategies come into play; these are very likely to result in a win for player 2, who is the one not starting.
