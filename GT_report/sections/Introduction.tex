\section{Introduction} \label{section:Introduction}% Riccardo

In this work, we want to apply game theoretic tools to the analysis of a real-life tabletop game, called Primi Composti.

Our objective is first of all to understand whether this specific game is unfair, in the sense that it favours one player over another independently of their "skill" level. Additionally, we also want to study the efficacy of approximated strategies for players, taking inspiration from fundamental concepts like security strategies but adapting them to a real-world scenario, where computational power is limited.

However, before delving into the specifics of those topics, we want to first present the game rules and then introduce our approach to its modelling.
